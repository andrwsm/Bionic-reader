# Bionic-reader
Bionic reading generator


I have had always found it difficult to read long text as I tend to lose my place or focus while reading and then have to jump back. After looking
into it, a lot of people have this problem too. There is a method called bionic reading which has been popularised by viral videos on social media. I wanted a way to turn any text that I wanted into this bionic reading form but they were all payed methods which I obviously did not want to do. So I made my own using JS, HTML and CSS. The code allows any length of input with an adjustable container, and outputs the text in a bionic reading format.
